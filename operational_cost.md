## üíº Operational Cost Control

This section focuses on understanding and managing the operational costs related to invoice processing ‚Äî a key to improving efficiency and maximizing return on investment (ROI) from automation and outsourcing.

---

### üîç Objectives

- Analyze **administrative costs** related to invoice handling.
- Calculate the **cost per invoice** processed, comparing manual vs. automated workflows.
- Evaluate the **ROI** from process automation or outsourcing in Accounts Payable (AP).

---

### üßæ Dataset Overview

This analysis relies on combining invoice-level data with operational cost metrics:

| Table         | Description                                      | Key Columns                                             |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Invoices**   | Invoice details with processing metadata         | **InvoiceID** (PK), **ProcessingType** (Manual/Auto), **Amount** |
| **Costs**     | Operational costs associated with AP processes | **CostID** (PK), **Category** (Admin, Automation, etc.), **Amount**, **Period** |

- **ProcessingType** ‚Äî Indicates whether invoice was processed manually or automatically  
- **Category** ‚Äî Cost category, e.g., administrative overhead, automation software licenses  
- **Amount** ‚Äî Cost or invoice amount

### üí° Key Findings (Sample)

> The average cost to manually process one invoice was **$7.65**, compared to **$3.13** for automated processing.  
> Total administrative costs for AP exceeded **$2,200**.  
> Automation initiatives resulted in a **35% reduction** in operational costs, yielding an estimated ROI of **150%** within the first year.

### üõ† Tools & Techniques

- **Power BI** ‚Äì Cost allocation, benchmarking  
- DAX ‚Äì Average cost calculations, ROI metrics

<pre><code class="language-dax">
TotalAPCosts = 
SUM('Costs'[Amount])
