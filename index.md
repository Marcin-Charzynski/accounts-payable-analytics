## 📂 Accounts Payable Analytics

Welcome! I'm Marcin — a data analyst with a focus on financial operations and process improvement through data.

This project explores key analyses related to the **Accounts Payable (AP)** function, including payment behaviors, vendor relationships, and liquidity risks. Using tools like **Excel**, **Power BI**, and **SQL**, I simulate real-world reporting scenarios to support decision-making and compliance in corporate finance.
