## 💼 Accounts Payable Analysis

Welcome! I'm Marcin — a data analyst with a focus on finance and automation.  
This project explores real-world challenges in the **Accounts Payable department**, with a series of focused analyses that support cash flow management, vendor relations, and payment efficiency.

Each page contains a specific area of analysis based on simulated transactional data and typical KPIs like DPO, overdue aging, and vendor behavior patterns.
